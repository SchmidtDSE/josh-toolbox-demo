Josh has built in logic for performing replicates across a range of josh configurations defined as `.jshc` files. I think we should set up some basic infrastructure to run several replicates across a range of elevation intensity, survival rates, etc etc, in order to find the best set of conditions to indicate the behaviors we expect in `DEMO_PLANNING.md`.

Alongside this effort, we should create a new `tuning_workflow.ipynb` showing how this process works. As with `demo_workflow.ipynb`, this should be self-contained - all reports and csvs and such should be generated by the notebook and not created manually outside of the notebook.
