# =============================================================================
# ELEVATION EFFECTS
# =============================================================================
# Elevation creates a spatial gradient in ecological outcomes:
#   - LOW elevation: Invasives thrive, seedling survival is reduced
#   - HIGH elevation: Invasives struggle, seedlings survive better
#
# The goal is to show that "High elevation areas will recover on their own;
# we should prioritize management in low elevation burned areas."
#
# TUNING GUIDE:
#   - If patterns are too subtle: INCREASE reduction values
#   - If invasives never grow at high elevation: DECREASE invasiveElevationReduction
#   - If seedlings always die at low elevation: DECREASE seedlingElevationReduction
#   - Effects are applied in zones (high/medium/low elevation)
#
# Zone thresholds (defined in model):
#   - High elevation: >= 60%
#   - Medium elevation: 30-60%
#   - Low elevation: < 30%

# Initial invasive cover reduction at HIGH elevation (after fire)
# This determines if high-elevation burned areas start BELOW establishment threshold
# CRITICAL: Must be > (fireHighInvasiveCover - establishmentThreshold) for natural recovery
# TUNED: 60% reduction ensures high-elev starts well below threshold
elevationInitialInvasiveReduction = 60 percent
elevationMediumInvasiveReduction = 30 percent

# Invasive growth rate reduction at HIGH elevation (per year)
# At high elevation, invasive growth rate is reduced by this amount
# TUNED: 50% reduction nearly eliminates invasive growth at high elevation
# This creates the strong spatial pattern we need for management insights
elevationInvasiveGrowthReduction = 50 percent
elevationMediumGrowthReduction = 25 percent

# Seedling survival bonus from elevation (percent mortality reduction at HIGH elevation)
# At high elevation, seedling base mortality is reduced by this amount
# TUNED: 40% reduction gives strong survival advantage at high elevation
seedlingElevationReduction = 40 percent
seedlingMediumElevationReduction = 20 percent

# Juvenile survival bonus from elevation (percent mortality reduction at HIGH elevation)
# Juveniles are more established, so elevation matters less
juvenileElevationReduction = 6 percent
juvenileMediumElevationReduction = 3 percent

# Establishment threshold - natives can't establish above this invasive cover level
# This is the critical threshold for the management insight
# If initial invasive > this, no seedling establishment is possible
# TUNED: 20% threshold makes natives highly sensitive to invasive competition
nativeEstablishmentThreshold = 20 percent
