# Simulation Results

This directory contains **raw simulation output** from the Josh engine.

## Canonical Files

| Pattern | Description | Generated By |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `<scenario>_<replicate>.csv` | Patch-level output for each scenario | `demo_workflow.ipynb` cell "run-scenarios" |

Current scenarios:
- `baseline_0.csv` - No fire, no intervention (control)
- `fire_only_0.csv` - Fire without management
- `fire_seeding_0.csv` - Fire + seedling planting
- `fire_removal_0.csv` - Fire + invasive removal
- `fire_both_0.csv` - Fire + both interventions

## CSV Structure

Each row represents one patch at one time step:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `step` | Simulation year (0-50) |
| `position.x`, `position.y` | Patch coordinates |
| `numSeedling`, `numJuvenile`, `numAdult` | Tree counts by life stage |
| `numAlive` | Total living trees |
| `invasiveCover` | Invasive grass cover (percent) |
| `newSeedlings` | Seedlings born this step |
| `fireSeverity` | Fire severity at this patch (0-1) |
| `elevation` | Elevation at this patch (percent) |

## Regenerating Files

Run the scenarios cell in `demo_workflow.ipynb` (cell "run-scenarios").

## Notes

- Raw output files can be large (7-10 MB each)
- Aggregated summaries are saved to `analysis/summaries/`
- Visualization figures are saved to `analysis/figures/`
